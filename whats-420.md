# ðŸŒ¿ Whatâ€™s 420?

## ðŸŽ‚ Cheda's Big Birthday Bash 2024

Many of you reading this will know that last year I threw a birthday party over the August bank holiday.

Those of you who were able to join us can attest that we had an awesome weekend.

Highlights include swimming in the river, relaxation on the lawn, the impromptu Kubb and Volleyball tournaments.

Not to mention the late night, limbo, bonfires and dancing through into the early hours of the morning.

## ðŸ¥³ So is 420 another birthday party?

Yes and no. Truthfully, last years birthday party was more of a trial run for 420.

It is still the same month as my birthday, so feel free to shower me with gifts.

## ðŸ¤¨ Okay, so what is 420 about?

Growing up, I was fortunate to find myself in the company of some truly wonderful friends. They were kind, loyal and generous with their time.

We loved to party, be it birthdays, gigs, festivals, wakes or weddings. Any excuse, any event, count us in, we were down.

Fast forward a couple of decades and I have enjoyed many more, arguably too many and have met more wonderful people along the way.

My vision for 420 is to celebrate you all by inviting you to join us.

## ðŸ˜ƒ Awesome, so what will that look like?

Broad stokes, every 2nd weekend of August I'll be inviting you all to join me at my home in Wales.

Rhysgog Farm, is nestled in the Dee valley, just outside Llangollen and I am very fortunate to be able to call it my home.

The epic Welsh vistas along with it's handy location and features make it the perfect venue to host 420.

This year, the event will run the full course of the weekend, Friday 8th to Sunday 10th of August.

You are encouraged to camp over, we have plenty of space for tents/vans. We also have campsite style facilities. There is also the Chainbridge hotel 1km away should you want to splurge.

Each day there will be loads of games and activities, music and opportunity to play in the river.

Each night there will be the obligatory campfire and the barn will be filled with decor, lighting and DJ's pumping to the early hours.

Those of you who like a drink are welcome to bring you're own, but there will also be a licensed bar with draft beer, cider and spirits at sensible pub prices, not festival prices.

There will also be some food. I'm not sure exactly what this will be as yet, keep an eye out for updates nearer the time.

I'm expecting this year's turn out to be similar to last year, 75 - 125 people.

I'm hoping to grow by 50 - 100 people each year so that by 2029, when I'm 42, we should have ourselves a most excellently curated little shindig with roughly 420 guests, belter!

## ðŸ‘¶ Family Friday

I have a family, I love them very much, I'm very proud and I want you to meet them.

And if you have a family I want to and can't wait to meet them too, a bunch of mini you's, awesome!

Friday is the day to do this, everything planed will be suitable for all, including the evening entertainment.

Saturday onwards however will be a child free, this may change in future years but for now this is the way.

If you plan to stay for the main party Saturday night then you will need to find off site childcare from Saturday morning onwards.

## ðŸ¤© This all sounds great, anything else?

There is a WhatsApp community set up [here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/L4TlA1kxRngAwGHuwQ7b8P?mode=ac_c), please join it for further updates.

Don't fret, I'm pretty hopeless with messaging so you won't be spammed with announcements.

If you would like to volunteer to help with set up, run an activity, perform, photography, DJ, help with pack down or anything else, there is set up under the [WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/L4TlA1kxRngAwGHuwQ7b8P?mode=ac_c).

As much as I would love to bankroll the whole thing like last years party, it just isn't sustainable long term.

So to come you'll need super reasonably priced [ticket](/tickets).

It's cheaper than a night out but if you really can't afford it message me and we will work something out.

I look forward to seeing you all soon.

Peace, love, unity and respect,

Cheda xxx
