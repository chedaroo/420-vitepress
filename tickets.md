# Tickets

As much as we would love to fully bankroll the whole thing like last years party, it just isn't sustainable long term.

That said, we strongly believe 420 should be affordable for all, price should stop anyone from attending.

An adult ticket will grant admission for the full weekend and includes camping.

Family Friday is free for kids and heavily reduced for teens.

Saturday onwards is 18+ only, children must be off site Saturday morning latest, be sure to arrange childcare if you plan to stay the duration.

Any question please check out the [FAQ](/faq) or if you're still none the wiser [contact us](https://www.tickettailor.com/promoter/contact-form/420).
